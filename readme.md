In the index.html file, add the following line in the ```<head>``` section:
```html
<link id="sf-theme" href="_content/KLib/klib.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

and, if you don't have it already, add the bootstrap library (v5/5.3) following the instructions in the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).
